What's new

👥 Staff Management System

Track everyone who's working your event in one place — from VIP door greeters to vendor move-in coordinators.

Add staff members with roles, shifts, contact info, and confirmation status. Edit everything inline with instant updates.

Quick-add multiple staff at once (up to 20 rows) for fast data entry. No more clicking "Add" a dozen times.

Sort and filter by name, role, shift, or confirmation status to see who's confirmed and who still needs a follow-up.

Export to Excel with one click — copy-to-clipboard gives you clean tabular data that pastes perfectly into spreadsheets.

See real-time stats showing total staff, confirmed, and pending counts right at the top.

🤖 AI Document-to-Tasks

Upload event documents (PDFs, Word, Excel files) and let AI extract actionable tasks automatically.

Drag and drop your vendor contracts, event timelines, or planning documents — AI reads them and suggests specific tasks.

Review and edit AI suggestions before creating tasks. Change titles, priorities, due dates, or skip suggestions you don't need.

Create multiple tasks at once from your document with bulk selection.

Works with PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and images. Processing happens automatically in the background.

🎯 Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board

Move tasks between columns by dragging — "Not Started" to "In Progress" to "Completed" in seconds.

Real-time status updates happen instantly. No more clicking edit buttons just to change a task status.

Smooth animations and visual feedback show you exactly where tasks are moving.

Works perfectly on mobile — touch-friendly drag handles make it easy on phones and tablets.

📅 Days Until Event Counter

See a beautiful countdown right on your event page showing exactly how many days until your event.

Smart date detection automatically uses end dates when available, or falls back to start dates.

Modern gradient design with subtle animations that catches your eye without being distracting.

Different color themes for event owners vs vendors so you can quickly see whose events you're viewing.
